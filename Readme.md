# PyTak #

This is a collection of python software dedicated to Tak. Initially, the repository is being dedicated to the analysis
of the PlayTak database of games.

```python DatabaseCrawler```

## Programs ##

### Database Crawler ###

Currently this is the only program and it is intended to crawl through the database and perform a variety of operations
on the PTNs. At the moment, all it does is to match all games to the same alignment, since there are many symmetrically
identical games.


## To-Dos ##

* Finish the Symmetry program
* Pull initial few moves from games into a Tree structure to analyze opening moves
